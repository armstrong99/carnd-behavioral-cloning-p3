Overview
---

This is the third project of the Udacity Selfdriving Car nanodegree.The project is about to train the car to almost go around the track. I have used modified NVIDIA architecture and different data augumentation technique to train the model.

The project has following files: 
* model.py
* drive.py
* model.h5
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track)
